            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THings here are almost come to their heighth, the prevalent party being purely for the—and by reason of their plausible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> are gone from their Cause, destroy Monarchy, set up all opinions, yea, a generall Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: By this they carry many well-meaning men with them, Yet notwithstanding there is a party of Noble men, you know them, Ministers and others, who out of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> will doe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161686:3"/>all just things, do oppose the prevalent party, bitterly protest in the House, hinder them abroad, The Ministers (also) do most stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppose, have sent in this day a Declaration contrary to the Parliaments, and indeede quite frustrates it, The prevalent party are quite madde about it, for it layes open the madnesse of theirs all along. Sir upon the whole matter, I conceive there is no way to save <hi>England,</hi> but by union and mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence between those called Presbyterians and Independents, without which I see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ruin from our own Kingdom, and hence also. Sir if you let these Cavaliers long continue, you will not easily fetch them out, they get in provision and strengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: If there were foure or five thousand horse, and so many foot on the borders now, it were to purpose, for the <hi>Scots</hi> can hardly declare for them, and if against them, then they cannot subsist long, although I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident nothing is done but by command of the prevalent party here, yet they show it not publiquely. For yesterday was a long debate, on the Commissioners of <hi>Englands</hi> Papers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161686:3"/>sent in, wherein the Commissioners declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those in <hi>Barwick</hi> Enemies and Traytors to the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to doe so for <hi>Scotland,</hi> they have referred it to the consideration of the bodies. Sir I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you labour for a union, and let all sides lay themselves low (God hath don so) to save the whole. I have sent you the copy of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of a wild fellow, called <hi>Jock</hi> of <hi>Bread, Scotland.</hi>

            <p>THat your Petitioner hath waited pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently at your Honors doores these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, expecting a happy conclusion to the great affaires and cause of God, for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161686:4"/>Religion and peace, but I know not how my hope languishes, as my feare increases, through the prevalencies of the Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi> and presumption of Malignants in both kingdomes, the first tollerating all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and the last no religion, so that I know not what to say or do, but my recourse is to your Honours, who can best ease me; by weighing all in the ballance of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall judgement: Wherfore my humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is, that your Lordships would take out the beame out of my eye, before you take the moate out of my Brother <hi>George</hi> of <hi>England</hi> his eye; for I fear he will hardly disband his Sectaries, when you tell him, you will set up an Army of my Malignants; or that he will indure to have his Parliament declared to be under the Black Rod, so long as mine is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the White: Or that he will permit the toleration of all Religions at the suite of him that hath none, when I have both a Church and honest men to seek it, or that hee will think any great oddes between reposing no more confidence in <hi>Charles,</hi> and my setting up <hi>James</hi> And likewise humbly desireth, that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161686:4"/>as you desire him not to imploy Sectaries, in any places of trust, so you would purge your owne House from those that were Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists of old, and of late Malignants, such as anti-Covenanters, Banders, Crosse-petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Delinquents, Compliers, with Rebels, protected persons by Rebels, Sea-Forts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, &amp;c. And then I should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, the honest religious Church-party of discenting Protestants should be able to doe all things, more effectually for Religion, King and Country, then can be expected, or really intended by many of them: And doe not think that faire words, or Declarations can serve my turne, since I heare the kernell of your Committee of Twenty foure, drives me to an ingagement of Warre, as did appeare by my first comming from my Brother of <hi>England,</hi> by making honest <hi>David Lashly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently draw the Troopes and Foot Regia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments together upon my Border, when that failed, then by high and bigge words, and bringing in all the Malignants party of my Brother of <hi>England,</hi> but neglecting these, you now seem to plead for, <hi>Hollis, Waller, Massey,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161686:5"/>Poyns, Lewis, &amp;c.</hi> and all this upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking with the King, which I will not yet discover: And now I know all Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are alterable, and are the only blindes that States use to deceive by. So againe, and again, I humbly beseech you to follow the advice of the Church in Church-matters, and imploy faithfull and honest men in your Courts and Armies, whom they may trust, then shall I hope to come speed, and beware of explaining the 29 Article of the Parliament 1641. Which is my onely Liberty, all this I pray for at your Honours hands, and your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Answer.</p>
